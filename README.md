# Short Circuit

## Desciption

Short Circuit is 3D puzzle game based off a circuit board. You play as an electric current whose goal is to reach the CPU port; however, you have a limited supply of power! Find the optimal path and watch out for those darn bugs.

## Instructions

Controls:

- Use the arrow keys to move the player

## Current Features

Player has unlimited moves with the goal of finding the CPU Port amidst the dark maze. Player can move only where there is a wire path; meaning the player cannot move off the circuit board or into a wall. Once the player reaches the CPU Port, input controls will stop.

| Electric Current | Object that player controls             | A ball of light that glows autonomously |
| Wires            | Shows path that the player can traverse | None                                    |
| CPU Port         | The end goal                            | Player will enter the port              |
| Fan              | Fun decoration, serves as a wall        | Blades spin autonomously                |
| Chips            | Fun decoration, serves as a wall        | None                                    |
| Capacitor        | Fun decoration, serves as a wall        | None                                    |

## Future Features

Player has a limited number of moves corresponding to their "power supply". Once the player reaches the CPU Port, they will enter a new level/ circuit board.

| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Wires           | Shows path that the player can traverse                   | Will light up if player passes over                |
| Capacitor       | Power up station for the player to replenish their supply | Stops glowing when player passes over              |
| Switch (Button) | Activates the switch "bridge" when given power            | Active and Non-Active states                       |
| Switch (Bridge) | Connects wire paths so player can cross                   | Up and Down states                                 |
| Bug/ Virus      | Enemy that obstructs path; moves when player moves        | A growing and shrinking (spiky?) ball (autonomous) |
| Resistors       | Provide a possibly shorter path but requires power        | None                                               |

# A three.js Playground “Wrapped” in React

That is all—everything else is whatever _create-react-app_ autogenerates.
Please refer to the [three.js website](https://threejs.org) for three.js-specific details.

(autogenerated content starts here)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
